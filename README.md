Firstly, farmers can check the health of their crops using our website. If a disease is detected, they are redirected to our ONDC marketplace, where they can purchase the necessary fertilizers. After harvesting, if there is crop residue left, farmers can rent machinery to manage this waste effectively. By using these machines, carbon emissions are significantly reduced, earning the farmers carbon credits. These carbon credits can be sold, providing a valuable boost to the farmer's income, making their practices more sustainable and profitable.
